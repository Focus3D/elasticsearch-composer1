## Usage

The `elasticsearch-php` client offers 400+ endpoints for interacting with 
Elasticsearch. A list of all these endpoints is available in the 
[official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html)
of Elasticsearch APIs.

Here we reported the basic operation that you can perform with the client: 
index, search and delete.

* [Creating an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_creating_an_index)
